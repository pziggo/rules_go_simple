# Bazel Rules Author Course
This repository contains exercises that complement EngFlow's Bazel Rules Author course. If you are not currently in the course, please inquire with EngFlow to schedule a session.

## Before you get started
Ensure that you have access to the slides before proceeding.

## VSCode Devcontainer instructions
1. Click on `Reopen in Conatiner` launch a new container.
1. Wait for the container to finish setting up.
1. Once you get a shell prompt in your codespace, run `./next_exercise.sh` to move to `exercise-001-simple_go_binary`.

```bash
./next_exercise.sh
```

### Note
`./next_exercise.sh` **is destructive**:
- it removes any untracked files you created (via `git clean`)
- it reverts any changes to tracked files (via `git reset --hard`)
- ...before checking out the branch for the next exercise.

If you would like to save any work, clone locally and commit before running any scripts.
